## THIS IS NOT A PROJECT

Just a repo with things i found useful at some point.

You can find most if not all or more of these on [my pastebin](https://pastebin.com/u/lcast15) as well.

## Nevertheless here's some small descriptions

* **Directory Scanner:**			small function that takes a directory and scans it and subfolders for files, compiling them into a list.
* **Number 2 Ordinal:**			turns numbers into ordinals. e.g. **1** becomes **1st**, **1000** becomes **1000th**, etc.
* **SteamID 2 SteamID64:**			converts SteamID to SteamID64. e.g. **STEAM_1:0:48421251** becomes **76561198057108230**, **STEAM_0:1:0** becomes **76561197960265729**, etc.
* **Number 2 Pretty String:**			converts a number to a string with commas. e.g. **1000** becomes **1,000**, **10000000** becomes **10,000,000**, etc.
